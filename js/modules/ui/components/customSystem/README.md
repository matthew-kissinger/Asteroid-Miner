## Technical Implementation

### Design Patterns
- **Manager Pattern**: Each module is a manager class for its domain
- **Dependency Injection**: Modules receive their dependencies
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Centralized event handling
- **Facade Pattern**: Main class provides simplified interface

### Memory Management
- All modules implement `cleanup()` methods
- Event listeners are properly registered and removed
- Timeouts and intervals are tracked and cleared
- DOM elements are properly dereferenced

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation at multiple levels
- Graceful error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
