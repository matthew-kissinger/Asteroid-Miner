# Solar System Asteroid Miner - Todo List

## UI Improvements
- [ ] Add start screen with:
  - [ ] Stylized title text (no logo)
  - [ ] "Play" button (triggers intro for new players or goes directly to stargate for returning players - logic for that is already built in)
  - [ ] "How to Play" button
  - [ ] "Settings" button
- [ ] Fix HUD elements:
  - [ ] Display current star system name as location
  - [ ] Fix thrust indicator
  - [ ] Synchronize fuel level display with actual fuel amount. i.e. if it is 200 it only shows the gauge up to 100
- [ ] Create proper Game Over screen:
  - [ ] Show reason for game over - planet, sun, asteroid, no fuel(working), died in hoarde (working), dying to enemy (not working)
  - [ ] Display final score (not resources)
- [ ] Streamline Stargate Terminal UI:
  - [ ] Make interface more compact
  - [ ] Improve layout and usability

## Gameplay Mechanics
- [ ] Implement scoring system
  - [ ] Add "dopamine hit" rewards for achievements
  - [ ] Add increase to score for time alive, asteroid mining, and destroying enemies
  - [ ] Display score prominently in HUD
- [ ] Balance asteroid mining:
  - [ ] Reduce time needed to break asteroids (mining once should break it)
- [ ] Adjust turret mechanics:

- [ ] Lock Horde Mode button until enemies are activated in gameplay

## Visual Effects & Polish
