# Skybox Generator

A web application for generating space skyboxes and planet textures using Google's Gemini AI. The application consists of a FastAPI backend and a JavaScript frontend.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI application deployed on Heroku
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/JS/CSS application deployed on GitHub Pages
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Image Generation**: Google Gemini AI with prompt engineering

## Security Features

- JWT authentication with 1-hour token expiration
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- In-memory token storage (no localStorage)
- CORS restriction to GitHub Pages domain
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- HTTPS-only communication

## Backend Deployment (Heroku)

1. **Create a Heroku account and install the CLI**
   ```bash
   # Install Heroku CLI
   # For macOS
   brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
   # For Ubuntu
   curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
   # For Windows: Download installer from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Heroku**
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

3. **Create a new Heroku app**
   ```bash
   heroku create your-skybox-generator
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   heroku config:set JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_string
   heroku config:set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   heroku config:set GITHUB_PAGES_URL=https://matthew-kissinger.github.io
   heroku config:set VALID_CLIENT_IDS=game_client
   ```

5. **Deploy the application**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment"
   git push heroku main
   ```

6. **Verify deployment**
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```

## Frontend Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. **Create a GitHub repository**
   ```bash
   # Initialize repository (if not already done)
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   
   # Create repository on GitHub and push
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-skybox-generator.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Update the API URL in apiClient.js**
   Update the `getApiBaseUrl()` method to point to your Heroku app:
   ```javascript
   getApiBaseUrl() {
       // For local development
       if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1') {
           return 'http://localhost:8001';
       }
       
       // For production
       return 'https://asteroid-miner-api.herokuapp.com';
   }
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - Select "main" branch and "/" (root) folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Verify deployment**
   - Your site is available at `https://matthew-kissinger.github.io/Asteroid-Miner/`

## Local Development

1. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a .env file**
   ```
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_local_secret_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   VALID_CLIENT_IDS=game_client
   ```

4. **Run the backend**
   ```bash
   uvicorn api_server:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

5. **Run the frontend**
   Serve the static files using a local server:
   ```bash
   # If you have Python installed
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # If you have Node.js installed
   npx serve -s .
   ```

## Security Considerations

- The JWT secret key should be a strong, random string
- All API communication uses HTTPS
- Tokens are stored in memory, not localStorage
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- CORS restrictions prevent cross-site requests
- Security headers are set for all responses

## Troubleshooting

- **Token errors**: Check that JWT_SECRET_KEY is set correctly and matches on both environments
- **CORS errors**: Verify GITHUB_PAGES_URL matches your actual GitHub Pages URL
- **Rate limiting**: The API has rate limits to prevent abuse. Wait before making more requests
- **Gemini API errors**: Ensure your API key is valid and has access to Gemini 2.0 models
