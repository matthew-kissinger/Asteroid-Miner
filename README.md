## Development Workflow

This project uses Vite for an optimized development experience:

* **Hot Module Replacement:** Changes reflect immediately without a full page reload.
* **Fast Builds:** Blazing fast build times with efficient bundling.
* **Asset Optimization:** Automatic asset optimization during production builds.
* **Local Dev Server:** Automatic port assignment and network access options.

## Usage

*   **Start:** The game begins docked at the stargate (after an optional intro sequence on first play).
*   **Undock:** Use the "UNDOCK" button in the stargate interface.
*   **Controls (Desktop):**
    *   `W`: Thrust Forward
    *   `S`: Thrust Backward
    *   `A`: Strafe Left
    *   `D`: Strafe Right
    *   `Shift`: Boost
    *   `Mouse`: Rotate Ship (Requires clicking in the game window to lock pointer)
    *   `Left Click`: Fire Weapon
    *   `R`: Toggle Mining Laser (must have an asteroid targeted)
    *   `E`: Toggle Target Lock-On System (optimized with clean top-screen display)
    *   `Tab`: Cycle Locked Target
    *   `F7`/`F8`: Adjust Controller Sensitivity (gamepad users)

## Performance Optimization

The game includes several settings to optimize for different hardware capabilities:

* **Post-Processing Effects:** Toggle bloom, anti-aliasing, and other visual effects
* **Volumetric Lighting:** Choose between standard god rays, "Claude Rays" effect, or disable for performance
* **Resolution Scaling:** Adjust rendering resolution for better performance
* **Graphical Quality Presets:** Choose Performance, Balanced, or Quality presets

## Production Build

When you run `npm run build`, Vite creates an optimized production build:

* **Tree-Shaking:** Eliminates unused code for smaller bundle sizes
* **Minification:** Reduces file sizes for faster loading
* **Asset Hashing:** Facilitates efficient caching
* **Code Splitting:** Improves initial load times by loading only what's needed
* **Smart Chunking:** Optimized chunk sizes for better network performance

## Future Scaling Capabilities

The codebase preserves foundational elements for advanced optimizations, intended for future scaling if needed. These are not all actively used in the current version but are maintained for potential integration:

*   **Data-Oriented Design (DOD) Components:**
    *   Utilizes TypedArray-based component storage in `js/core/dataStore.js`.
    *   Includes optimized component variants in `js/components/optimized/` (e.g., for transforms and rigidbodies).
    *   These offer highly efficient memory layouts and access patterns, crucial for scenarios with thousands of entities.
*   **Conceptual Basis for Instanced Rendering:** While specific `InstancedRenderSystem` files as detailed in `architecture.md` may not be in the current active path, the design anticipates leveraging `THREE.InstancedMesh` for rendering large numbers of similar objects (e.g., asteroids, debris) with minimal draw calls. The foundational DOD components would support managing data for such instanced systems.
*   **Optimized Physics Concepts:** The architecture includes provisions for specialized physics systems, potentially using the DOD components, for high-performance simulation when dealing with a large number of entities.

These preserved systems and concepts could be more fully implemented or re-activated to support:
1.  Massive asteroid fields (e.g., 1000+ asteroids).
2.  Large-scale space battles with numerous ships and projectiles.
3.  Complex particle effects and debris systems.

For a more detailed technical discussion of these preserved systems and their original design, please refer to `architecture.md`.
