## Overview

Navigate the cosmos in your mining vessel, extract valuable resources from asteroids, and trade them at the mothership to upgrade your ship. Explore multiple star systems, each with unique resources and challenges.

## How to Play

1. **Controls:**
   - WASD: Ship movement
   - Mouse: Ship rotation
   - Click: Fire particle cannon
   - SHIFT: Boost
   - E: Target lock-on
   - TAB: Cycle targets
   - R: Toggle mining
   - Q: Dock with mothership

3. **Mining Resources:**
   - Approach asteroids and use your mining laser
   - Different resources have different values and mining times
   - Watch your cargo capacity as you mine

4. **Upgrading Your Ship:**
   - Return to the mothership and dock (press Space when near)
   - Sell resources for credits
   - Purchase upgrades to improve your ship's capabilities

5. **Exploring the Universe:**
   - Travel between star systems via the star map at the mothership
   - Each system has different resource distributions
   - Watch your fuel levels when planning longer journeys

# Skybox Generator

A web application for generating space skyboxes and planet textures using Google's Gemini AI. The application consists of a FastAPI backend and a JavaScript frontend.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI application deployed on Heroku
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/JS/CSS application deployed on GitHub Pages
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Image Generation**: Google Gemini AI with prompt engineering

## Security Features

- JWT authentication with 1-hour token expiration
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- In-memory token storage (no localStorage)
- CORS restriction to GitHub Pages domain
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- HTTPS-only communication

## Local Development

1. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a .env file**
   ```
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_local_secret_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   VALID_CLIENT_IDS=game_client
   ```

4. **Run the backend**
   ```bash
   uvicorn api_server:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

5. **Run the frontend**
   Serve the static files using a local server:
   ```bash
   # If you have Python installed
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # If you have Node.js installed
   npx serve -s .
   ```

## Security Considerations

- The JWT secret key should be a strong, random string
- All API communication uses HTTPS
- Tokens are stored in memory, not localStorage
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- CORS restrictions prevent cross-site requests
- Security headers are set for all responses

## Troubleshooting

- **Token errors**: Check that JWT_SECRET_KEY is set correctly and matches on both environments
- **CORS errors**: Verify GITHUB_PAGES_URL matches your actual GitHub Pages URL
- **Rate limiting**: The API has rate limits to prevent abuse. Wait before making more requests
- **Gemini API errors**: Ensure your API key is valid and has access to Gemini 2.0 models
